# Challenge #1_Big Bang

This JavaScript code iterates through 1 to 100 and replaces any number divisible by 3 with the word
BIG and number divisible by 5 with the word BANG. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, it replaces it with BIG BANG. The generated array is written to ‘output.json’ file with result as follow:

[“1”, “2”, “BIG”, “4”, “BANG”, “BIG”, “7”, “8”, “BIG”, “BANG”, “11”, “BIG”, “13”, “14”, “BIGBANG”,
.... all the way to 100]
